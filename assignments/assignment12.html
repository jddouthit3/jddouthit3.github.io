    <p id="learnParagraph">Well, first of all congratulations! If your sorry ass manages to find yourself on this website, it means that you might have the opportunity to leave the house for the first time in a few
      months. These first date recommendations are guaranteed to lead to some sweet, sweet love. And remember, if you manage to kiss your partner, it's great to compliment their breath. You can say "I like the smell of your breath. It tastes like honeydew melon on a Sunday morning." As always, be safe out there kids.</p>
