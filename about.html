        <h1> About</h1>
        <h4><em> Find meaning, anywhere </em></h4>
        <p> John Douthit is one part student, one part musician, and a generous dash of pure comedy. A self-taught musician--not student--his band <a id="midway-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2uG0ZMRrhTxjtoLD4IQHjY">Midway</a> enjoys the
        success of having 15 dedicated monthly listeners on Spotify. His passion for producing music will eventually land him success, but while he is waiting to break onto the music scene, he is
        getting a degree in Operations Management and Social Responsibility & Sustainability. He will be joining Seagate Technology this summer during the day and recording Midway's upcoming full-length album The Parallel at night.
